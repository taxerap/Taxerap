# Taxerap

I'm Taxerap, someone that's... someone.  

## Contacts

**Email**: taxerap@gmail.com  
~~**Personal Website**: erap.tax~~ _(down for now)_

## Introductory documents

Contents here may be English, may be Chinese. I don't have the intention of writing two versions since no one's going to read them. I'll just use whatever language that's easiest for me to write for that time being.
