## Contacts

**Email**: taxerap@gmail.com  
~~**Personal Website**: erap.tax~~ _(down for now, I don't have anything to do with it anyways)_

## Actually finished works without over-promising

**[NameGen](https://github.com/Taxerap/NameGen)**  
A program that generates nicknames by a consonant-vowel-consonant... format.  
This is probably the first ever _thing_ I completed on a computer. I got it done back in middle school, when I was playing with Java because I wanted to make Minecraft mods.

**[Finc](https://github.com/Taxerap/Finc)**  
A small utility program, finding all the _.c_ files under ./src folder for me to copy-paste into shell script for compiling C programs.

**[Tilmi](https://github.com/State-of-War-PostBar/Tilmi)**  
A tool for making til and tmi resources for the game _State of War_.

## Other documents

Contents here may be English, may be Chinese. I don't have the intention of writing two versions since no one's going to read them. I'll just use whatever language that's easiest for me to write for that time being.
